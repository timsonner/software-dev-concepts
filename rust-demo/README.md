# My Rust Project

This project is a simple demonstration of Rust programming concepts, including basic types, structs, enums, and traits. It serves as a learning tool for those new to the Rust language.

## Project Structure

```
my-rust-project
├── src
│   ├── main.rs      # Entry point of the application
│   └── lib.rs       # Contains struct definitions and implementations
├── Cargo.toml       # Configuration file for Cargo
└── README.md        # Documentation for the project
```

## Getting Started

To build and run this project, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Building the Project

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
cargo build
```

### Running the Project

After building the project, you can run it using:

```
cargo run
```

## Code Overview

### `src/main.rs`

This file contains the `main` function, which demonstrates the use of basic types, structs, and creating instances of those structs.

### `src/lib.rs`

This file defines a struct and implements methods for that struct. It also includes examples of using enums and traits to demonstrate object-oriented concepts in Rust.

## Learning Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as you learn more about Rust!
